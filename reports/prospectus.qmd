  This research aims to address the intricate dynamics of transparency in legal and healthcare interpreting settings, contributing to the enhancement of communication efficacy within these critical domains. The study is prompted by the observed gap in understanding specific transparency requirements and challenges that influence the clarity and accuracy of communication. Drawing insights from key articles, including Jimenez (2004), Monteoliva-Garcia (2018), Kiseleva et al. (2022), and Kaufert and Putsch (1997), the research focuses on uncovering the nuanced elements within the patient-interpreter-physician relationship and legal interpreting practices. 
  The primary research question guiding this investigation is: How do power dynamics and transparency challenges impact effective communication in legal and healthcare interpreting? To address this question, the research objectives include delving into the intricacies of transparency, identifying challenges faced by interpreters, and proposing best practices to foster transparent communication. The methodology involves qualitative analysis of the power dynamics, transparency nuances, and self-regulation within the patient-interpreter-physician relationship, supplemented by a meta-analysis of legal interpreting research practices. Additionally, the study explores the intersection of legal requirements and technical limitations in AI-driven healthcare communication. 
  The expected impact of this research is to offer valuable insights that contribute to the refinement of communication practices in legal and healthcare settings. By unveiling the complexities of transparency, the study aims to improve outcomes for all stakeholders involved, fostering a more effective and ethical communication environment.
  As the research progresses, particular attention will be given to addressing challenges related to data availability, ensuring a robust and comprehensive exploration of the identified articles, and seeking expert consultation to refine the research focus and gather additional insights. The study holds the potential to significantly advance our understanding of transparency dynamics, ultimately benefiting the fields of legal and healthcare interpreting.

## Draft a research statement

The identified research problem lies in the need to delineate specific transparency requirements and challenges within legal and healthcare interpreting settings. While existing literature underscores the importance of transparency, a significant gap exists in understanding the precise elements contributing to effective communication. My research seeks to address this gap by investigating the power dynamics, transparency nuances, and self-regulation within the patient-interpreter-physician relationship and legal interpreting practices.

The primary research question is: How do power dynamics and transparency challenges impact effective communication in legal and healthcare interpreting? The objectives include uncovering the nuanced aspects of transparency, identifying challenges faced by interpreters, and proposing best practices for fostering transparent communication. The expected impact of this research is to contribute valuable insights to enhance communication in legal and healthcare settings, ultimately improving outcomes for all stakeholders involved.
