    "text": "Draft a research statement\n\nThe identified research problem lies in the need to delineate specific transparency requirements and challenges within legal and healthcare interpreting settings. While existing literature underscores the importance of transparency, a significant gap exists in understanding the precise elements contributing to effective communication.\nMy research seeks to address this gap by investigating the power dynamics, transparency nuances, and self-regulation within the patient-interpreter-physician relationship and legal interpreting practices.\nThe primary research question is:\n\nHow do power dynamics and transparency challenges impact effective communication in legal and healthcare interpreting?\n\nThe objectives include uncovering the nuanced aspects of transparency, identifying challenges faced by interpreters, and proposing best practices for fostering transparent communication. The expected impact of this research is to contribute valuable insights to enhance communication in legal and healthcare settings, ultimately improving outcomes for all stakeholders involved.",
